The project builds off decades of basic ecological work on the behaviour and physiological limits of cane toads. This was supplemented by a suite of simulation modelling of invasions across mapped landscapes to test scenarios.  The project is now in implementation phase and looks to build an ongoing partnership between indigenous landowners (Nyangumarta and Karajarri) and pastoral landholders to deliver the containment zone.
