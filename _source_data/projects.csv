The project builds off decades of basic ecological work on the behaviour and physiological limits of cane toads. This was supplemented by a suite of simulation modelling of invasions across mapped landscapes to test scenarios.  The project is now in implementation phase and looks to build an ongoing partnership between indigenous landowners (Nyangumarta and Karajarri) and pastoral landholders to deliver the containment zone.

We will create a new open-access online tool to allow spatial planning of urban biodiversity conservation actions. Expected outcomes include enhanced capacity for developers, environmental consultants and local governments to measure potential urban biodiversity outcomes at a range of scales. This should provide significant benefits to human well-being by increasing the efficiency of urban nature conservation and restoration in cities.","Dr Holly Kirk","Australian Research Council, Development WA, Lendlease, WSP Consulting, City of Melbourne, Knox City Council, Josh Byrne Associates","https://storage.tally.so/private/IMG20230520121704.jpg?id=pAB4EB&accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6InBBQjRFQiIsImZvcm1JZCI6Im1Pcnl6WSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NjE1OTQ1Mn0.INESG5HqjEZTBMSujDECMaaTnRYw0erveO4g-l8JP-M&signature=ae6acb8fcfcdd8d00b63f8eb520442fc0406a4c22891424846bf26614e464983"

The project aims to improve the resilience and efficiency of road network operations during non-recurrent traffic events such as accidents, adverse weather, and infrastructure disruptions.

In partnership with Main Roads Western Australia (MRWA) and Roads and Maritime Services New South Wales (RMS NSW), the project integrates advanced mathematical modeling, fractional differential equations, and machine learning algorithms to develop real-time, data-driven traffic control and prediction strategies.

Under Professor Wiwatanapataphee’s management, the project has delivered significant innovations, including distributionally robust ramp metering systems and predictive freeway traffic control models tailored for high-impact, dynamic conditions. These strategies are informed by rich datasets from government partners and validated through computational simulations and empirical analysis.

The project demonstrates the value of academic-industry collaboration, resulting in both cutting-edge theoretical contributions and practical tools now being considered for operational use by transport authorities. Professor Wiwatanapataphee’s leadership has been critical in coordinating multi-disciplinary teams, reporting milestones, and engaging stakeholders, reinforcing her capacity to lead national-scale, impactful research initiatives.

Initially, the model will assess an optimal liming strategy, however could later be adapted to soil amelioration investments,  insurance evaluations,  property valuations or securing banking loans.

A Food Agility CRC  funded project delivered in collaboration with DPIRD, Curtin University and GGA, the project development was guided by consultation with grower groups, growers, agronomists, farm consultants, agtech and data providers over 10 months. 

The project is developing a data transfer infrastructure leveraging DPIRD’s eConnect platform. It will seamlessly transfer data from the growers’ farm management software to the model and then return it to the grower using APIs.

A whole of farm Monte Carlo simulation model has been created that ingests farm management records and generates thousands of scenarios allowing the model to account for seasonal variability in weather and commodity prices. This provides certainty regarding the optimal strategy and the risks associated with it.

Basic Description

The {SPIChanges} package was created to detect changes in rainfall patterns and quantify how they affect the probability of a drought event, quantified by the SPI (Mckee et al. 1993), occurring. The package applies a nonstationary approach proposed by Blain et al. (2022), designed to isolate the effect of such changes on the central tendency and dispersion of the SPI frequency distributions.

The package depends on R (>= 2.10) and imports the following packages: {lubridate}, {zoo}, {gamlss}, {gamlss.dist}, {stats}, {spsUtil}, {rlang}, {brglm2}, and {MuMIn}.
