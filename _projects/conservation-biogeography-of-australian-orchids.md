description: "Australia boasts one of the highest diversities of terrestrial orchid species in the world, with substantial rates of endemism. Many of these species today are restricted to small pockets of remnant native vegetation resulting from the cumulative impacts of introduced herbivores, land conversion to urban and agricultural uses, and altered fire regimes. In many cases the niche envelope of these species is poorly understood, and their historical distribution is relatively unknown. This imposes difficulty in their management in the face of rapidly changing climates, which may vastly alter the suitability for many species. This project uses niche envelope and habitat suitability modelling to reconstruct the change in habitat suitability for a range of terrestrial orchids across the southern half of the continent, and to estimate future scenarios to guide conservation and management."
