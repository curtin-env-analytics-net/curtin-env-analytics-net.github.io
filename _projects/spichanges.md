description: "SPIChanges is an R package designed to improve the interpretation of the Standardized Precipitation index (SPI) under changing climate conditions.

Basic Description

The {SPIChanges} package was created to detect changes in rainfall patterns and quantify how they affect the probability of a drought event, quantified by the SPI (Mckee et al. 1993), occurring. The package applies a nonstationary approach proposed by Blain et al. (2022), designed to isolate the effect of such changes on the central tendency and dispersion of the SPI frequency distributions.

The package depends on R (>= 2.10) and imports the following packages: {lubridate}, {zoo}, {gamlss}, {gamlss.dist}, {stats}, {spsUtil}, {rlang}, {brglm2}, and {MuMIn}.
