description: "This project aims to help growers make more sophisticated investment decisions using their farm data. Initially, the model will assess an optimal liming strategy, however could later be adapted to soil amelioration investments,  insurance evaluations,  property valuations or securing banking loans.

A Food Agility CRC  funded project delivered in collaboration with DPIRD, Curtin University and GGA, the project development was guided by consultation with grower groups, growers, agronomists, farm consultants, agtech and data providers over 10 months. 

The project is developing a data transfer infrastructure leveraging DPIRD’s eConnect platform. It will seamlessly transfer data from the growers’ farm management software to the model and then return it to the grower using APIs.

A whole of farm Monte Carlo simulation model has been created that ingests farm management records and generates thousands of scenarios allowing the model to account for seasonal variability in weather and commodity prices. This provides certainty regarding the optimal strategy and the risks associated with it.

Adam led this work while working at DPIRD prior to joining Curtin in 2024."
