title: Terrestrial ecosystem biomonitoring with eDNA across the tree of life: the Olympic Dam case study
image: terrestrial-ecosystem-biomonitoring-with-edna-across-the-tree-of-life-the-olympic-dam-case-study.jpeg
funders: ['BHP']
collaborators: ['Paul Nevill']
description: "This project will develop and validate cutting edge molecular tools to assess terrestrial biodiversity (soil microbial communities, plants invertebrates, and vertebrates) and commence development of an eDNA based metric for evaluating the condition of terrestrial ecosystems. This approach to ecosystem monitoring will advance the study of individual species to understanding entire ecosystems and how species interconnect."
