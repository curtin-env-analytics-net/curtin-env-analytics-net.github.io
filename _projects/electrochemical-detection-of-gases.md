funders: ['Sensirion']
collaborators: ['Debbie Silvester-Dean']
description: "This research involves the detection of gases such as oxygen, hydrogen, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, chlorine, ethylene, methylamine using electrochemical methods on miniaturised electrodes. The main focus is on developing the materials for the electrode and electrolyte to detect these gases at analytically relevant levels, primarily for workplace safety applications. Ionic liquids and poly(ionic liquids) are exploited as electrolytes."
