collaborators: ['Todd Robinson', 'Lewis Trotter']
description: "Groundwater dependent vegetation will die if groundwater is depleted beyond their root systems. In the Pilbara, a major cause of this is from dewatering iron ore pits to extract the iron ore below the water table. This project was two pronged: firstly, use remote sensing to detect GDV and secondly, to monitor it for any loss of vigour. We created a suite of tools that could plug in to ArcGIS for simplifying the process. "
