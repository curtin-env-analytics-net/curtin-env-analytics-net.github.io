description: "This ARC Linkage Project (LP170100341) is led by a team of researchers with Professor Benchawan Wiwatanapataphee from Curtin University serving as Project Manager and one of the main investigators. The project aims to improve the resilience and efficiency of road network operations during non-recurrent traffic events such as accidents, adverse weather, and infrastructure disruptions.

In partnership with Main Roads Western Australia (MRWA) and Roads and Maritime Services New South Wales (RMS NSW), the project integrates advanced mathematical modeling, fractional differential equations, and machine learning algorithms to develop real-time, data-driven traffic control and prediction strategies.

Under Professor Wiwatanapataphee’s management, the project has delivered significant innovations, including distributionally robust ramp metering systems and predictive freeway traffic control models tailored for high-impact, dynamic conditions. These strategies are informed by rich datasets from government partners and validated through computational simulations and empirical analysis.

The project demonstrates the value of academic-industry collaboration, resulting in both cutting-edge theoretical contributions and practical tools now being considered for operational use by transport authorities. Professor Wiwatanapataphee’s leadership has been critical in coordinating multi-disciplinary teams, reporting milestones, and engaging stakeholders, reinforcing her capacity to lead national-scale, impactful research initiatives.
