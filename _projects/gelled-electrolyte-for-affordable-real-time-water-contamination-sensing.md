description: "We have developed a gel that can be used together with commercially available miniaturised electrodes to detect water contaminants instantly without the need for expensive, time consuming, and complex lab-based tests. Our novel electrolyte gel is based on ionic liquids and poly(ionic liquids) and uses electrochemical techniques for the detection. In combination with commercially available disposable “test-strips” (thin-film electrodes), we plan to create energy-efficient and battery-operated sensors for water testing which are well-suited for remote or off-grid environments due to their portability and robustness.
