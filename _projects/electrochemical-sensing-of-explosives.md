description: "This project focusses on the electrochemical detection of explosive compounds, such as TNT, DNT, RDX, HMX, PETN, tetryl, for forensic, security and industrial safety applications. Miniaturised electrodes with specially designed materials are used to target the explosives to enable their detection. TNT has been detected both dissolved in water samples, and in solid form on surfaces, using polymer films with specially designed characteristics. This is a rapid, low-cost way to detect explosives onsite, without the need to take samples back to the lab for analysis."
