description: "Australia has an unenviable track record in the range collapse and extinction of terrestrial mammals, resulting from the combined threats of introduced predators, habitat loss, and changed fire regimes. Consequently, much attention has been focused on understanding these losses in order to prevent, or even reverse them.
Australia's unique avifauna have also suffered from these same threatening processes, but there has arguably been less visible effort in understand how, and how to respond for their conservation. Emerging biogeographical simulation tools have proven to be powerful tools in reconstructing range collapses and extinction trajectories of Australian mammals, and avifaunal megafauna in New Zealand. This project aims to incorporate many of the advances in this field, and apply to them to understanding patterns of range collapse of Australia's threatened birds."
