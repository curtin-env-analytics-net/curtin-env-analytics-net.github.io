description: "This project aims to reduce the complexity of planning for biodiversity during urban development by enabling industry and government to visualise and measure the potential performance of different urban designs. We will create a new open-access online tool to allow spatial planning of urban biodiversity conservation actions. Expected outcomes include enhanced capacity for developers, environmental consultants and local governments to measure potential urban biodiversity outcomes at a range of scales. This should provide significant benefits to human well-being by increasing the efficiency of urban nature conservation and restoration in cities."
