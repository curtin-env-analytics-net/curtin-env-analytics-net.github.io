We undertake a range of activites to bring the network together both formally and informally.

## Coding Club

Coding club is a place to meet other coders, to learn coding tricks, and to get inspired. We meet once a month, for a short informal talk by someone in CEAN about their latest interesting coding project, and then we get down to collaborative coding on projects that coding club members have dreamt up.

Current coding club projects include:

- Leveraging machine learning to identify individual trees from aerial imagery
- An app for interacting with trees on campus
- A Western Australian colour palette, for plots and documents.

## CEAN Seminars

These happen once very few months. We invite an external speaker -- someone doing interesting work in environmental analytics -- to give a full seminar, followed by afternoon tea and chit chat. Anyone is welcome to attend.
