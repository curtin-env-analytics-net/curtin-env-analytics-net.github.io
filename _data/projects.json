    "description": "A once in a lifetime opportunity has emerged for us to stop the spread of cane toads. More than a decade of scientific work indicates that, by managing artificial waterpoints in the coastal strip between Broome and Port Hedland, we can halt the toad invasion. Establishing this Toad Containment Zone (TCZ) will keep toads out of the Pilbara and potential habitat as far south as Shark Bay. This action benefits the environment, but also communities in the Pilbara and further south; across 27 million hectares of Western Australia.",
