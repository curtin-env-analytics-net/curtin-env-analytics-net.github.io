<p>The Curtin Environmental Analytics Network is a group of more than 40 academics across three Schools at Curtin University.  We are united in our passion for understanding the environment through analysis, but we each bring a different approach.  Because of this, the network encompasses an astonishing breadth of expertise.  There are not many problems in environmental analytics that we cannot solve.</p>

<p>CEAN is also dedicated to ongoing learning and training.  We support a large postgraduate community, industry engagement, and ongoing learning through a range of dedicated activities including a coding club, a seminar series, and industry hackathons.</p>
