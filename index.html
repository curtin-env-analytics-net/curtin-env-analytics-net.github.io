<p>
  The Curtin Environmental Analytics Network is a group of more than 40
  academics across three Schools at Curtin University. We are united in our
  passion for understanding the environment through analysis, but we each bring
  a different approach. Because of this, the network encompasses an astonishing
  breadth of expertise. There are not many problems in environmental analytics
  that we cannot solve.
</p>

<p>
  CEAN is also dedicated to ongoing learning and training. We support a large
  postgraduate community, industry engagement, and ongoing learning through a
  range of dedicated activities including a coding club, a seminar series, and
  industry hackathons.
